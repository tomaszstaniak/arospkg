/* Web addresses in PkgManager: one way to show, open and copy them.
 *
 * Texts are shown by a Linktext view (zunekit, compiled into this program):
 * a link stands where it occurs in its sentence, wraps with the text and
 * scrolls with it. A click hands the full address to openurl.library, which
 * passes it to the browser the user chose in Prefs/OpenURL; that happens in
 * a small process of its own, so the window never waits for a browser to
 * start. The context menu and Amiga+C copy the full address to the clipboard
 * (unit 0), at any length. Other schemes stay text.
 *
 * Without openurl.library a click says so and copying still works. If the
 * view cannot be made, a Floattext shows the same words with the addresses
 * written out, and the program runs. */
