/* HTTPS transport, ported from docs/spikes/network-download/dl.c, which is
 * where each of these rules was established and measured on mainline AROS.
 *
 * The spike's two deliberate differences from the older aros-hardcode
 * transport are the reason this file exists at all, and both are kept:
 *   - the CA bundle is mandatory; if it will not load we stop rather than
 *     "continue unchecked". An unverified download is the whole attack.
 *   - the certificate must match the name we asked for. SSL_VERIFY_PEER alone
 *     validates the chain and would accept any valid certificate for any name.
 *
 * The response is read into memory before being written out. That is what the
 * spike did and it is proven; it caps a download at max_bytes and is the
 * reason net_fetch takes one. Streaming to disk is worth doing when packages
 * get large, and is not worth doing before the rest of this works.
