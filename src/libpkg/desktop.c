/* Opening an installed package's drawer on the desktop: `apkg open` and
 * PkgManager's Open folder button.
 *
 * The drawer comes from the registry entry ("dir", relative to the root),
 * never from the index or from the id: the registry is what says where this
 * installation is. The desktop is asked through workbench.library's
 * OpenWorkbenchObjectA, which takes the path as a string -- no Shell command
 * is built, so spaces and other characters in the path need no quoting --
 * and hands a drawer to whichever program registered as the desktop
 * (Wanderer on AROS One), not to a file manager named here.
 *
 * OpenWorkbenchObjectA starts a program when given a file, and searches the
 * command path when given a bare name (AROS source, openworkbenchobjecta.c).
 * So it is only called with a full path to an existing drawer. Nothing in
 * the registry or the drawer is written. */
