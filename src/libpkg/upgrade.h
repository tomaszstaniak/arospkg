/* The plan of an upgrade (or of a rollback, which is an upgrade with the
 * roles swapped): what to add, replace, remove and keep, decided from three
 * inventories and nothing else, so it can be tested on the host and printed
 * before a byte moves.
 *
 *   old   what the registry says the installed revision contained
 *   new   what the staged tree of the target revision contains
 *   live  what is in the drawer now
 *
 * The rules, per path:
 *   in new and old, same content upstream  -> UNCHANGED: the live file stays
 *                                             whatever the user did to it;
 *                                             absent live -> ADD (the package
 *                                             is delivered complete)
 *   in new and old, changed upstream        -> live absent: ADD
 *                                             live == old: REPLACE
 *                                             live == new: UNCHANGED (already)
 *                                             otherwise:   CONFLICT
 *   in new only                             -> live absent: ADD
 *                                             live == new: UNCHANGED
 *                                             otherwise:   CONFLICT
 *   in old only                             -> live absent: nothing
 *                                             live == old: REMOVE
 *                                             otherwise:   KEEP_USER
 *   in live only                            -> KEEP_UNKNOWN
 *
 * A CONFLICT is a file the user changed (or put there) that the target
 * revision wants to overwrite. One conflict stops the whole operation before
 * anything is touched; there is no "take theirs" in this increment, because
 * the answer is the user's to give and nothing here can give it for them. */
