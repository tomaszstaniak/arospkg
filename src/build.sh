# Build apkg for ABIv11 -- AROS One x86_64. THE DEFAULT BUILD.
#
# v0.1 targets ABIv11 (decided 2026-09-19): that is where the catalogue is --
# 171 ABIv11 candidates against 7 for mainline. build-mainline.sh stays as an
# additional build and does not gate a release.
#
# A second binary, not a flag: a program built for one ABI does not start on the
# other. See docs/reference/abi.md. Everything about the two builds that differs
# is here, and it is more than the compiler path:
#
#   * OpenSSL is 1.1.0h (2018) rather than 4.0.1, so the hostname check uses
#     SSL_set1_host() -- net.c picks by OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER.
#   * The C library is one libcrt.a rather than mainline's split
#     libposixc/libstdcio/libstdc.
#   * zlib is linked STATICALLY, as in the mainline build. The SDK's libz.a is
#     a stub that opens z1.library at startup. AROS One 1.3 does ship
#     z1.library, so the stub worked -- but a release binary with a runtime
#     library dependency nobody documented is the thing requires_system exists
#     to prevent, so the dependency is removed rather than documented.
