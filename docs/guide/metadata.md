# arospkg metadata reference

What every field means **today**, and who checks it. For how to fill it in,
see the [packaging guide](../guide/packaging.md). For formats that are only
proposed, see the [RFCs](../rfc/). If this file disagrees with the code, the
code is what runs, and this file needs fixing.

## Three files, three writers

| | **manifest** | **index** | **registry** |
|---|---|---|---|
| file | `manifests/<id>.<arch>.toml` in arospkg-index | `index.json` in arospkg-index | `<root>/db/installed/<id>.json` |
| format | TOML | JSON, `schema: 1` | JSON, `schema: 1` |
| written by | the index maintainer (the author may draft it) | `tools/mkindex.py`, never by hand | the client, when it installs or upgrades |
| read by | `mkindex.py` | `apkg`, `PkgManager` | `apkg`, `PkgManager` |
| describes | one package build, as reviewed | every published build | one installation on one machine |

```
manifests ──mkindex.py──▶ index.json ──apkg update──▶ <root>/db/index.json ──install──▶ <root>/db/installed/<id>.json
 (reviewed)               (derived)                    (the machine's copy)                (what happened here)
```

- **Nobody writes the index by hand.** Change the manifest and regenerate.
- **The registry is not something an author writes.** It records what the
  client did on one machine: when, from which URL, which files with which
  hashes, and what the requirement probe found. A package cannot supply
  one, and it is never published.
- An archive's own `.arospkg/manifest.toml` is **not** one of these files.
  Nothing reads it today. See [RFC 0001](../rfc/0001-package-format.md).

## The manifest

All keys are top-level unless shown inside a table. Keys `mkindex.py` does
not know are ignored without a warning.

**Every string must be printable ASCII, and must contain neither `"` nor
`\`.** The 0.3 client does not decode JSON escapes. It would act on
`1.0 \"beta\"` instead of `1.0 "beta"`, and on `\u00e9` instead of `é`.
`mkindex.py` refuses any string it would have to escape. Strings the client
acts on (`id`, `version`, `arch`, `abi`, `url`, `subdir`, `icon`, and the
`id` and `type` of each requirement) are also refused when they are longer
than the client holds. Strings it only shows (`summary`, `category`, `kind`,
`license`, `source`) get a note instead, and the client shortens them.

**Required** means that `mkindex.py` rejects the manifest without it.
**Index** says which index key the value is copied to. **Client** says what
the 0.3 client does with it.

### Review state

| field | type | required | default | meaning and constraints |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `status` | string | yes | none | `"approved"` is published; anything else is rejected. Generated candidates carry `"skeleton"`, which means nobody has reviewed them. There is no other status. |
| `excluded` | string | no | none | A reason. If present, the manifest is rejected as a deliberate exclusion, whatever else it says. |
| `depends_checked` | boolean | yes, and it must be `true` | `false` | Someone has checked what the package needs from other packages. An empty `depends` with `depends_checked = false` means nobody has looked yet. It does not mean the package needs nothing. Not copied to the index. |
| `upload_date`, `selected_by` | string | no | none | Where a generated candidate came from in the catalogue. Not copied to the index. |

### Identity

| field | type | required | default | index | client | meaning and constraints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | none | `id` | registry key; installed drawer is `<root>/<id>`, icon `<root>/<id>.info` | `^[a-z][a-z0-9._-]{0,63}$`, and at most 63 characters (refused otherwise: the client keeps 63). Stable: a different `id` is a different package. Unique per `arch` in one index. |
| `version` | string | yes | none | `version` | compared for equality only | Upstream's own version string, opaque. Example `"0.1.0-rc3"`. At most 63 characters. |
| `revision` | integer | no | absent | `revision` | absent reads as 0; shown as `<version>-aros<revision>`; upgrade requires the same `version` and a higher `revision` | This port's release count for that `version`: an integer from 1 to 2147483647. Anything else is refused. |
| `summary` | string | no | `""` | `summary` | shown; searched | One line, no trailing full stop. Client keeps 159 characters. |
| `category` | string | no | `""` | `category` | shown; searched | AROS Archives style, `"game/strategy"`. Client keeps 63 characters. |
| `kind` | string | yes | none | `kind` | shown in ARexx `INFO`; no effect on installing | `"app"` for everything published so far. Client keeps 15 characters. |
| `license` | string | no | absent | `license` | shown by `show` and in the window | Free text. Nothing checks it. Client keeps 63 characters. |

### Target

| field | type | required | default | index | client | meaning and constraints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `arch` | string | yes | none | `arch` | must equal the client's CPU, or install is refused before download | `"x86_64"`, `"aarch64"`; 0.3.1 also recognizes `"i386"`. |
| `abi` | string | yes | none | `abi` | must equal the client's, or install is refused before download | `"v11"`: ABIv11, including AROS One. `"v1"`: mainline. 0.3.1 also recognizes `"v0"` for the i386 ABIv0 line. Missing or unknown ABI is not native compatibility. |

**Choosing between builds.** The client collects the entries with the
requested `id`, and keeps those whose `arch` and `abi` both match its own
(compatibility `native`):

- exactly one: that entry is used;
- none: `install` is refused (wrong CPU, wrong ABI or unknown ABI), and
  `show` describes the first entry in (`arch`, `abi`, `url`) order;
- more than one: `install` and `upgrade` refuse rather than pick.

The order of entries in the file never changes the choice. An upgrade stays on
the `arch` and `abi` recorded in the registry. `mkindex.py` allows only one
manifest per (`id`, `arch`), so an index it generates cannot hold both a `v1`
and a `v11` build of one id.

**Compatibility is not "runs".** `native` means the CPU and the ABI match,
nothing more. Requirements are reported separately, and only a test on a real
system says it runs.

### Archive and integrity

| field | type | required | default | index | client | meaning and constraints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `url` | string | yes | none | `url` | fetched over HTTPS only, redirects followed | The exact file. Must start with `https://`, and be at most 511 characters. Must not change content. |
| `size` | integer | yes | none | `size` | download must have exactly this size, or it is discarded | Bytes, a positive integer. Not compared with the file. |
| `sha256` | string | yes | none | `sha256` | download must hash to it, or it is discarded; install refused if it is not 64 characters | Lower-case hex, 64 characters, of the archive at `url`. `mkindex.py` checks the form, not that it matches the file. |
| `subdir` | string | no | `""` | `subdir` | the part of the archive that is installed, as `<root>/<id>/` | <a id="subdir"></a>A directory at the archive's top level, no trailing `/`, at most 127 characters. `""` installs the whole top level, **including `.arospkg/` if present**. Only the members under `subdir/` are installed. Checked against the archive by `mkindex.py` when the archive is in `--cache`, together with the length of every path the client will store (at most 255 bytes inside the package). |
| `icon` | string | no | `""` | `icon` | extracted to `<root>/<id>.info`; install refused if the archive lacks it; an existing icon there is left alone and not claimed | The drawer icon, at most 127 characters. `mkindex.py` checks that the file exists in the archive, not what it is: whether it is the drawer icon and not the program icon is for the reviewer to decide. |

### Requirements and dependencies

| field | type | required | default | index | client | meaning and constraints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `requires_system` | array of tables | no | `[]` | copied as is | probed before download; *missing* refuses the install; *undetermined* installs with a warning and is recorded | What the machine must already provide. At most 16. |
| `requires_system[].type` | string | yes | none | | only `"library"` is probed | Any other value is accepted: `mkindex.py` prints a note and the client reports *undetermined*. |
| `requires_system[].id` | string | yes | none | | the library name | `"crt.library"`. At most 63 characters. |
| `requires_system[].min_version` | integer ≥ 0 | no | `0` | | `OpenLibrary(id, min_version)` | Only when you know it. No other keys are allowed in the table. |
| `depends` | array of strings | no | `[]` | `depends` | **not read in 0.3** | Other packages in the same index. `mkindex.py` drops a manifest whose `depends` cannot be met in the same `arch`, and repeats until nothing more is dropped. |
| `install` | table | no | `{}` | `install`, copied as is | not read | Reserved. No manifest uses it. |

A library requirement is decided on the machine, in this order:

1. the library is already open, at `min_version` or later: **satisfied**;
2. `OpenLibrary` succeeds: **satisfied**. This runs the library's
   initialisation, as the program would;
3. otherwise **missing**, and the message says whether a file of that name is
   in `LIBS:`.

A machine short of memory can report *missing* for a library that is there.

### Claims from testing

| field | type | required | default | index | client | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `installs_on` | array of strings | no | `[]` | copied | not read | Systems where the package was installed. |
| `runs_on` | array of strings | no | `[]` | copied | not read | Systems where it was started. |
| `does_not_run_on` | array of strings | no | `[]` | copied | not read | Systems where it is known not to run. |

The values used so far are `"aros-one"` and `"mainline-x86_64"`. There is no
fixed vocabulary, and nothing checks these claims. Write only what was done.

### Notes for the user

| field | type | required | default | index | client | meaning and constraints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `post_install_notes` | array of strings | no | absent | `post_install_notes` | shown after a successful install, by `show` and in PkgManager's details; copied into the registry entry at installation | Short plain text a user needs after installing, one string per line: game data to supply separately, a folder to choose at first start, where the manual is. At most 8 lines of at most 159 characters, printable ASCII without `"` or `\`. `mkindex.py` refuses anything else, and does not shorten it. |

The notes are text, nothing more: no markup, no variables, nothing is run,
and no terminal sequence can be in them. The package's author can write
them for their own package, or the index maintainer for an existing upload,
without repacking the archive. They do not replace structured fields: a
library the program needs belongs in `requires_system`, where the client
checks it. Do not repeat where the package is installed or how to open it:
the client prints both after every install, with the right path for the
user's package root.

These limits are what the current client can read safely, not the intended
shape of the format; Unicode and longer text need a client change first.

A client that does not know the key skips it. The registry's copy is a
record of what the user was told at installation, read when the catalogue no
longer has the package; the catalogue's text is the one maintained.

<!-- validate: fragment -->
```toml
post_install_notes = [
  "This port needs the data files of the original game.",
  "Copy them into the Data drawer, or choose their folder at first start.",
]
```

### `[source]`

Optional, recommended for anything built from source. It records where the
source is. Installing never needs it, never fetches it and never checks it,
and a missing `[source]` produces no warning.

| field | type | index | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `repository` | string | `source` (this value only) | Repository URL. Shown by `show`, 255 characters. |
| `revision` | string | none | A commit or tag, so the link names a fixed point. |
| `archive` | string | none | File name of a source archive published beside the package. |
| `sha256` | string | none | That archive's hash. |
| `built_with` | string | none | Toolchain or SDK profile. |
| `built_on` | string | none | Build date of that SDK, not of the package. |

A pinned repository and a hashed source archive are equally valid, alone or
together. Nothing in `[source]` proves that the sources produced the binary.

### A worked example

The manifest in [guide section 4](../guide/packaging.md#4-the-manifest) is
complete, and is checked by `tests/test_doc_examples.py`.

## The index

`mkindex.py` writes one JSON object:

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema` | `1`. The client does not check it. |
| `source` | The AROS Archives catalogue the candidates were imported from. **Not** the per-package `source`. |
| `packages` | Array of entries, sorted by `id`, then `arch`. |

This is the entry generated from the guide's manifest. The test checks that
it matches `mkindex.py`'s output exactly:

<!-- validate: index-entry -->
```json
{
  "id": "micropolis",
  "version": "0.1.0-rc3",
  "summary": "Classic city-building simulation for AROS",
  "arch": "x86_64",
  "abi": "v11",
  "category": "game/strategy",
  "url": "https://github.com/tomaszstaniak/aros-micropolis/releases/download/v0.1.0-rc3/micropolis.x86_64-aros-v11.lha",
  "size": 2593505,
  "sha256": "c46bbc14274af53fb4452f59081fbcf28f1ce5fffb534c06d169b0b1911cd124",
  "depends": [],
  "requires_system": [
    { "type": "library", "id": "crt.library" },
    { "type": "library", "id": "m.library" },
    { "type": "library", "id": "stdlib.library" }
  ],
  "installs_on": ["aros-one"],
  "runs_on": ["aros-one"],
  "does_not_run_on": ["mainline-x86_64"],
  "kind": "app",
  "subdir": "Micropolis",
  "icon": "Micropolis.info",
  "install": {},
  "revision": 1,
  "source": "https://github.com/tomaszstaniak/aros-micropolis",
  "license": "GPL-3.0-or-later with EA Section 7 terms; Micropolis Public Name License"
}
```

`revision`, `source` and `license` appear only when the manifest gives them.
`abi` is `null` when the manifest has none.

**How the 0.3 client reads it**:

- It skips keys it does not know, so new keys can be added.
- Strings are copied as they stand. JSON escapes are not decoded, so a
  non-ASCII character reaches the screen as `é`. **Use plain ASCII in
  every string.**
- Size. Each key counts as one JSON value, and so does each value, array
  and object; the published index averaged about 50 values and 874 bytes per
  package on 2026-10-04. Clients up to 0.3.2 hold at most 8192 values in a
  fixed array and take at most 4 MiB; past that they report *the index is
  not valid JSON*. Later clients allocate what the file needs, and refuse
  only past 1048576 values or 16 MiB, a guard against a broken file rather
  than a size the catalogue is meant to reach (5000 packages are about 4 MB
  and 241000 values); they are guards, not a promise that every machine has
  the memory for that much. Later clients fetch `index-v2.json`, with every
  package; `index.json` beside it keeps the packages it already listed,
  updated from the same manifests, within the old limits. `mkindex.py` writes
  both and prints the share of each limit; when the packages of `index.json`
  outgrow it, it writes neither and asks for a decision, and never shortens
  anything to fit.

## The local registry

Written by the client, one file per installed package, as
`<root>/db/installed/<id>.json`. The default root is `SYS:Packages`.
`apkg info <id>` prints it. This one is from the guide's walk, with the
contents list cut to one file (the full entry listed 130):

<!-- validate: registry -->
```json

  "schema":1,
  "name":"micropolis",
  "version":"0.1.0-rc3",
  "revision":1,

| key | from | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `schema` | client | `1` |
| `name` | index `id` | |
| `version`, `revision` | index | `revision` is `0` when the index gave none |
| `arch`, `abi` | index | The build installed; an upgrade stays on it. `abi` is missing in entries written before 0.3, and readers then assume the client's own. |
| `subdir` | index | How the archive was cut, so a rollback cuts the same way. |
| `installed` | client | UTC time of the install or upgrade. |
| `origin`, `archive_sha256`, `archive_size` | index, verified | The archive that was installed. |
| `reason` | client | Always `"explicit"` in 0.3. |
| `dir` | client | The drawer under the root: always the `id`. |
| `requires_system` | index + probe | Each requirement with its `state` (`satisfied`, `missing`, `undetermined`), `found_version` (`-1` if none) and the probe's words in `checked`. It records what this machine said at install time. |
| `icon` | client | `state`: `installed` (the icon belongs to the package), `kept-existing` (an icon was already there and was not touched) or `none`. When the icon was installed, `sha256` and `size` let removal tell whether Workbench has since rewritten it. `member` is its name in the archive. |
| `previous` | client | After an upgrade: the registry entry and archive it replaced, for `rollback`. Empty otherwise. |
| `contents` | client | Every installed file, with `path` relative to the drawer, `sha256` and `size`. Removal deletes a file only if it still matches. Directories are not listed. |

Other things under the root, all the client's:

- `db/index.json`, the index `apkg update` fetched;
- `db/transactions/`, the journal of work in progress;
- `db/previous/<id>.json` and `cache/previous/<id>.<ext>`, kept for rollback;
- `db/doctor/<id>-<n>.json`, what a removal left behind and why;
- `cache/<id>.<ext>`, the verified archive, kept after removal;
- `tmp/`.

## What is checked where

| check | `mkindex.py` | client | a person |
|---|---|---|---|
| status is approved, `depends_checked` is true | ✔ | | decides it |
| required keys present | ✔ | | |
| `id` pattern | ✔ | | chooses a stable name |
| `arch` is x86_64 or aarch64 | ✔ | equals its own CPU | |
| `abi` value | ✔ `v1` or `v11` | equal to its own | that the binary really is that ABI |
| one entry per (`id`, `arch`) | ✔ | refuses when several match | |
| `sha256` form | ✔ | 64 characters | |
| `size` and `sha256` match the file at `url` | none | ✔ on every download | measures them |
| `url` is HTTPS, reachable and stable | HTTPS ✔ | refuses anything but HTTPS; fetches it | chooses it |
| `subdir` and `icon` exist in the archive | ✔ if the archive is cached | `icon` ✔; `subdir` is not checked, and members outside it are skipped | that `icon` is the drawer icon |
| archive member paths and sizes | none | ✔ before writing anything | |
| `requires_system` shape | ✔ | ✔ | |
| `requires_system` is complete and correct | none | probes what is listed | derives it from the binary |
| `depends` exist in the index | ✔ | not read | |
| strings readable by the client, operational lengths | ✔ | reads them as they stand | |
| index.json fits clients up to 0.3.2 (8192 values, 4 MiB); index-v2.json fits later ones | ✔ both files | 0.3.2 reports invalid JSON past it; later clients read up to 1048576 values, 16 MiB | |
| `version`, `revision`, `summary`, `license`, `[source]` | `revision` range | display only | all of it |
| `installs_on`, `runs_on`, `does_not_run_on` | none | none | only claims that were tested |
| the program starts and keeps user data | none | none | ✔ |

**Neither tool authenticates anything.** A SHA-256 in the index proves that a
download is the file the index names. It does not prove who wrote the index,
and nothing is signed.

## Running `mkindex.py`

It reads every manifest in `--manifests` (default
`../arospkg-index/manifests`) and writes `--out` (default
`../arospkg-index/index.json`).

- A skeleton or an excluded manifest is left out and listed, and that is
  normal.
- If any manifest marked `approved` is refused, including one dropped for an
  unmet `depends` or a duplicate (`id`, `arch`), it prints `NOT WRITTEN`,
  leaves the previous `--out` as it was, and exits 1. The same happens when
  the index would not fit the client.
- Otherwise it writes the new index in one step (a `.part` file renamed
  over the old one) and exits 0.
- With `--cache`, `subdir` and `icon` are checked in any archive found
  there. An archive that is missing produces a warning, not a failure.

Unreviewed candidates are kept in this repository, in `index/candidates/`,
and are never published.

## Known limits and gaps

Found while writing this reference and checking the final index on 0.3.
Items 1 to 5 were fixed in `mkindex.py` on 2026-09-29. Items 6 to 11 are
limits of the 0.3 client or the tools, and are left as they are.

1. *Fixed:* `mkindex.py` exited 0 even when it refused approved manifests.
2. *Fixed:* `abi` was optional in `mkindex.py` but required by the client.
3. *Fixed:* `url` was not checked for HTTPS, and `revision` was not checked.
4. *Fixed:* strings the client reads differently (`"`, `\`, non-ASCII) were
   published. Measured on the client's parser: a `"` in `version` is stored
   escaped a second time in the registry, so the installed version never
   equals the index's again. A `\` in `url` fetches a different address.
   In `subdir`, no member matches, so the drawer installs empty. None of the
   published packages had such a string.
5. *Fixed:* operational strings longer than the client holds were published.
6. **The client does not decode JSON escapes.** The generator keeps such
   strings out of the index. Decoding needs a decision on characters beyond
   ASCII (the index is UTF-8, the AROS console Latin-1), and belongs to a
   later client.
7. **Only one manifest per (`id`, `arch`).** The client can choose between
   ABIs, but the generator and the file name `<id>.<arch>.toml` cannot hold
   a `v1` and a `v11` build of one id. This must change before such a pair is
   published.
8. **`icon` is checked for existence, not role.** A file inside the drawer
   can be named by mistake. It can also be a deliberate choice, so the
   location alone is not treated as an error.
9. **`subdir = ""` installs `.arospkg/`** along with everything else at the
   top level. RFC 0001 proposes skipping it; the 0.3 client does not.
10. **The removal report lists changed files, but not files the package never
    installed**, such as saved games. Both are kept. This is a gap in the
    report, not in the removal.
11. **Display strings are shortened** (`license` at 63 characters, and the
    others at the lengths above). The index keeps the whole value.
12. **Backslashes in archive member names.** The LHA reader turns `\` into
    `/`, and the ZIP reader refuses only a leading `\`. RFC 0001 proposes
    refusing them everywhere.
