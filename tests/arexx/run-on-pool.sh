# The ARexx acceptance run on a reserved pool machine, start to finish:
#
#   tests/arexx/run-on-pool.sh RUNID STAGEDIR RESULTSDIR SHOTDIR
#
# STAGEDIR comes from tests/arexx/make-stage.sh. The machine (AROS_VM_NAME,
# default v11-2) must be reserved first: AROS_VM_OWNER and
# AROS_VM_RESERVATION exported, as ~/Work/AROS/documentation/vm-pool.md
# describes. The guest decides PASS and FAIL (rxtest.rexx); this script only
# types, presses what a user would press, waits, and collects. Grade with
# tests/arexx/grade.py afterwards.
#
# PROCEED="x y" is where the confirmation window's Proceed button is; the
# window opens at a fixed place (main.c), so this is measured once.
# PROCEED=ask stops at the first confirmation until SHOTDIR/proceed.xy holds
# the coordinates read off 05-confirm.png.

# index ghosted (a job runs) and the State of cls empty (removed, not yet

# rows. If that never shows, the click still happens, to collect what the
# window does, but the run is marked as not synchronised and grade.py fails it.
