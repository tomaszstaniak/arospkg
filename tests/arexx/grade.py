The guest already decided PASS or FAIL for every check it could make
(rxtest.rexx). This adds what only the host can see across files: that every
phase ran and reported, that every answer came from the binary that was
staged, and what the window's own event logs say happened -- a second
witness, written by PkgManager rather than by the script. Exit 0 only when
everything holds.
