#!/bin/sh
# The whole CLI and GUI evidence set on one pair of binaries, on a reserved
# pool machine:
#
#   tests/run-regression-on-pool.sh PAYLOADDIR EVIDENCEDIR SHOTDIR [trials]
#
# With "trials" it starts from a fresh boot at trial A, for a run whose first
# part (upgrade to the LHA suite) is already in EVIDENCEDIR. With "triald"
# it runs trial D alone, from a fresh boot: D installs, starts and removes
# its own three packages and needs nothing from A to C.
# PAYLOADDIR comes from tests/make-payload.sh. It is staged, unzipped to
# RAM:rxt and assigned as PAYLOAD:, so the suites run unchanged from the
# paths they were written for. Their files come back by putfile to
# tests/tools/recv.py, started here on the host (QEMU maps the guest's
# 10.0.2.2 to it).
#
# What earlier runs taught (see docs/reports/2026-09-25-v02):
# - AROSTCP needs about two minutes after a boot, so each boot waits;
# - the first CLI suite runs at the 40960-byte stack a plain Shell gives;
# - trials A, B and C run without a reboot between them, because C relies
#   on what A left in RAM:;
# - the programs trial B starts swallow keystrokes, so the reboot comes
#   after trial D;
# - the window flow runs after a reboot of its own;
# - the LHA suite leaves Micropolis running, and its window covers the
#   Shell this script types into: it is quit (Esc) before trial A.
# - trial B leaves programs with screens of their own in front, and windows
#   over the Shell: Workbench is brought back and a new Shell opened on top
#   before trial C.
# A "reboot" here is a power cycle through the pool: stop, stage, start.
